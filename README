# Docker images for Gentoo repository checkers

## History

Testing your ebuilds on the CI have always been, in the best case, clumsy. /* Add reference to github travis old CI config file */
You had to create a standard ubuntu docker image, spin it up and hack up tools like repoman.

Being a bit tired of this, I looked for a gentoo docker image, so that one can just run it in his own _'natural'_ environment.

You can find the docker iamges here: https://hub.docker.com/urbsaquaeductus 

## Available images

**Notice**: repoman has been deprecated in the 2022. So here you can find a docker iamge with pkgcheck too.
